\title{
INM-CM4 temperature and forcing dataset.
}
\description{
This is the INM-CM4 temperature dataset. Also includes radiative forcing data obtained by combining the INM-CM4 forcing data and Hansen et al. (2010) such that the 18-yr moving averages are equal. The forcing slope coefficient when assuming a 1\% annual increase of CO2, which is used to estimate the TCR, is 3.0.
}
\usage{
data(INM_CM4)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\format{The data is a list that contains these objects:
  \describe{
    \item{Year}{
      Time index denoting the year of the observations.
  }
  \item{Temperature}{
      Annual global mean surface temperature.
  }
    \item{Forcing}{
      Annual adjusted radiative forcing.
  }
  }
